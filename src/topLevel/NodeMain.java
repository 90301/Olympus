	 * NOTES:
	 * 
	 * Hiring mechanics
	 * each person can work at most 3 buildings at a time.
	 * the building has a hire function.
	 * before hiring, the building will broadcast a call for applications
	 * each application will test the person being hired in a randomized stats test
	 * where a multiplier between .5 and 2 is multiplied by the applicants stat in question.
	 * an application can test 1 to 3 stats, some stats on the application are fixed for that job
	 * others are randomized.
	 * 
	 * STATS:
	 * There are likely to be a number of stats/personality traits for people. here are the major categories and
	 * sub stats.
	 * 
	 * Social Stats:
	 * 	Communication - improves understanding, and therefore efficiency in tasks requiring coordination.
	 * 	Management - improves efficiency in management related tasks, which improves the efficiency of all other workers.
	 * 
	 * Intellectual Stats:
	 * 	Math - improves efficiency in tasks requiring math.
	 * 	Engineering - improves ability to come up with solutions or improve designs for improvements to tiles.
	 * 
	 * Blue Collar Stats: (specialized labor)
	 * 	Machine work - efficiency in using machines to create or refine products.
	 * 	Strength - ability to work using ones own body
	 * 	Dexterity - ability to perform intricate work
	 * 
	 * ----------
	 * in addition to stats (which change slowly) there are skills that can have big effect on certain jobs
	 * Skills:
	 * Supply Chain Efficiency - negotiates margins for suppliers/distributors for the business. 
	 * (competition between supply chain position for both business)
	 * 
	 * Salary Negotiation - improves Salary directly (competition between hiring manager and worker)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ----------
	 * Motivation:
	 * Motivation serves as an overall multiplier for efficiency in working, as well
	 * as a general mood indicator.
	 * 
	 * motivation is a complex variable, that I have not decided how to implement yet
	 * so for right now, motivation will be at 1.0 always. motivation should be able to
	 * go from 0 to 2.0
	 *
